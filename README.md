# Run-REDUCE-FX

## A JavaFX GUI to run any CLI version of the REDUCE Computer Algebra System

### Francis Wright, June 2020

Run-REDUCE-FX is a re-implementation of
[Run-REDUCE](https://fjwright.github.io/Run-REDUCE/) using JavaFX
instead of Swing.  It does **not** (yet) provide typeset-quality
display of mathematical notation.  The latest version of Run-REDUCE-FX
requires Java 11 or later plus JavaFX 11 or later.

For information about how to install and run Run-REDUCE-FX please see
the [Install and Run
Guide](https://fjwright.github.io/Run-REDUCE-FX/InstallAndRun.html).
For information about how to use Run-REDUCE-FX please see the [User
Guide](https://fjwright.github.io/Run-REDUCE-FX/UserGuide.html) (which
is also included in Run-REDUCE-FX and easily accessible via the Help
menu).

Run-REDUCE-FX should run on any platform that supports JavaFX 11 (or
later), but I can only test it on Microsoft Windows and 64-bit Ubuntu.
(Whilst Java is portable, filesystem structures and installation
conventions are not!)

REDUCE itself is an open source project available from
[SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/reduce-algebra/).  I'm
releasing Run-REDUCE-FX under the [BSD 2-Clause License](LICENSE),
mainly because it's the license used by REDUCE.

This project is set up for development using [IntelliJ
IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) with Run-REDUCE-FX as the
top-level directory.

## Release Notes

### Version 1.1

* Avoid warning messages and hanging Help menu items on Ubuntu, but
  suppress display of PDF files via the Help menu on non-Windows
  platforms since it's probably not currently very helpful!
* Add instructions for installing and running using Java 11 on Linux
  and improve the appearance of the User Guide.
* Use CSS to set the REDUCE font, size, weight and colour, and use the
  same font and size for input as well as output.
* Validate direct input to the FontSizeDialog via the editor.
* Validate generic root directories in REDUCEConfigDialog.  Rebuild
  the Run REDUCE submenus on saving REDUCEConfigDialog.  Improve error
  messages.

### Version 1.2

* Update the build environment to Java 11 and JavaFX 11, which are now
  also required to run Run-REDUCE-FX.
* Provide batch files to run Run-REDUCE-FX more easily.
* Re-instate display of PDF files via the Help menu on non-Windows
  platforms.
* Fix truncated text in the About dialogue.
